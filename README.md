# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

## Assignment Objective

Belly Button Biodiversity dataset was analyzed to create an interactive dashboard which catalogs the microbes that colonize in human navels. 

Demographics information is displayed based upon a user input of test subject IDs. A bar chart and bubble chart update once the ID is changed by the user.

All JS, CSS, and images required for this assignment are located in the `static` folder. The main HTML file `index.html` is located in the root folder of the Github repo.

**The dashboard can be viewed here: <a href="https://samuelje.github.io/plotly-challenge/" target="_blank">Belly Button Diversity Dashboard</a>**
